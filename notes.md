## Docker Engine is madeup of three parts
* CLI
* REST API
* Daemon

> For all of them container can be either the container id or the container name. Same for images
##
> If we pressed `Ctrl + c` in the attached container, the container will stop. If we want to attach to a container while making sure we don't close it from the other terminal we can specify to not attach STDIN with `--no-stdin` option. Or we can detach from attached container by hitting `Ctrl + p`, `Ctrl + q` to detach us from the STDOUT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
eg. 
```bash
docker run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```
* The first part, docker run -d. Runs container detached.
* Followed by -it is short for -i and -t. -it allows you to interact with the container by using the command line.
* Because we ran the container with --name looper, we can now reference it easily.
* The image is ubuntu and what follows it is the command given to the container.
```bash
docker logs -f looper
docker pause looper
docker unpause looper
```
> to follow the output of logs of a running container and pausing the looper without exiting or stopping it
```bash
docker run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```
> start another process with -it and add --rm in order to remove it automatically after it has exited. The --rm ensures that there are no garbage containers left behind. It also means that docker start can not be used to start the container after it has exited.


> for accessing services runing in the host local, we can use the ip adress of the host. To find the ip address, we can run
```bash
dr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'dr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'
```
-  Usually like the following: `registry/organisation/image:tag`. But may be as short as `ubuntu`, then the registry will default to `Docker hub`, `organisation` to `library` and `tag` to `latest`. The organisation may also be a `user`, but calling it an organisation may be more clear.
- `docker run -it hello-docker sh` in this script we replaced the CMD of the dockerfile with `sh` and used `-i` and `-t` to start the container so that we can interact with it.
```bash
$ docker diff zen_rosalind
  C /usr
  C /usr/src
  C /usr/src/app
  A /usr/src/app/additional.txt
  C /root
  A /root/.ash_history
  ```
  - `A = added, D = deleted, C = changed.`

  - if a image has `ENTRYPOINT` defined, `CMD` is used to define it the default arguments. `ENTRYPOINT` vs `CMD` can be confusing - in a properly set up image, the __command__ represents an argument list for the __entrypoint__. By default, the __entrypoint__ in Docker is set as `/bin/sh -c` and this is passed if no entrypoint is set. This is why giving the path to a script file as `CMD` works: you're giving the file as a parameter to `/bin/sh -c`. If an image defines both, then the `CMD` is used to give default arguments to the __entrypoint__.

  - There are two ways to set the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`: `exec form` and `shell form`. We've been using the exec form where the command itself is executed. In shell form the command that is executed is wrapped with `/bin/sh -c` - it's useful when you need to evaluate environment variables in the command like `$MYSQL_PASSWORD` or similar.

|    __Dockerfile__             |       __Resulting command__        |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|`ENTRYPOINT` /bin/ping -c 3 `CMD` localhost  |  /bin/sh -c '/bin/ping -c 3' /bin/sh -c localhost  |
|`ENTRYPOINT`  ["/bin/ping","-c","3"] `CMD` localhost  |  /bin/ping -c 3 /bin/sh -c localhost  |
|`ENTRYPOINT`  /bin/ping -c 3 `CMD`  ["localhost"]  |  /bin/sh -c '/bin/ping -c 3' localhost  |
|`ENTRYPOINT` ["/bin/ping","-c","3"] `CMD`  ["localhost"]  |  /bin/ping -c 3 localhost  |

- Most of the time we can ignore `ENTRYPOINT` when building our images and only use `CMD`. For example, Ubuntu image defaults the `ENTRYPOINT` to bash so we do not have to worry about it. And it gives us the convenience of allowing us to overwrite the `CMD` easily, for example, with bash to go inside the container.

- We should use quote if the file name has space in it. eg.
```
docker cp "determined_elion://mydir/Welcome to Kumpula campus! ï½œ University of Helsinki [DptFY_MszQs].mp4" .
```
